## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

## Tooth Growth Dataset

```{r}
# Load a dataset into the R Environment.
data(ToothGrowth)

# Look at the summary of the variables in the dataset.
summary(ToothGrowth)

# Look at a frequency table of a categorical variable.
table(ToothGrowth$supp)
```
*This dataset investigates the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.*

*The two supplement delivery methods include OJ (orange juice) and VC (ascorbic acid).*

*It is a data frame with 60 observations and 3 variables.*

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# make sure to load the package ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, 
       aes(x = supp,
           y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
