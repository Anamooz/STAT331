## Tooth Growth Dataset

```{r}
# Load a dataset into the R Environment.
data(ToothGrowth)

# Look at the summary of the variables in the dataset.
summary(ToothGrowth)

# Look at a frequency table of a categorical variable.
table(ToothGrowth$supp)
```

*This dataset investigates the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.*

*The two supplement delivery methods include OJ (orange juice) and VC (ascorbic acid).*

*It is a data frame with 60 observations and 3 variables.*

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Box plot comparison of guinea pig teeth length from different supplement delivery methods"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp,y = len)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Box Plot Comparing Teeth Length Between 2 Different Supplement Delivery Methods", x = "Supplement Type", y = "Length")
```

## Summary of Data

The section includes the dataset of the growth of teeth length in guinea pigs using two different supplement methods. It also includes a comparsion of box plots between these two methods.


```{r}
# We will add code to conduct a t-test here! https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/t-tests-r-tutorial
t.test(len ~ supp, 
       data = ToothGrowth, 
       alternative = c("two.sided"),
       mu = 0,
       var.equal = FALSE,
       conf.level = 0.95,
       )
```
1. We fail to reject the null hypothesis, treatment mean tooth length for the OJ supplement delivery method is the same as the treatment mean tooth length for the VC supplement delivery method, based on the p-value of 0.06 with a standard alpha of 0.05 and conclude that both delivery methods are the same.

2. We are 95% confident that the true difference in means between teeth length of different supplement types of orange juice and ascorbic acid lies in the interval -0.1710156 to 7.5710156.

## Summary of T-Test

The section includes a t.test of the dataset of the growth of teeth length in guinea pigs using two different supplement methods. It also includes a conclusion and interpretation of the confidence interval of the t.test results.
